```

### Folder structure
The following shows the basic folder structure.
```

### Preporcessing


1) download the pretrained VGG model
```
Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/open?id=15WlRLFSYG-mQ73DpUngaUqOnUwtz4PPc

Baidu Cloud: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DVAwqe3n5JeUIuaAkzteYw  Password: byxj
```
2) download the checkpoint of our model and put it to 'checkpoint/coarse_224' folder
```
Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/open?id=15WlRLFSYG-mQ73DpUngaUqOnUwtz4PPc

```
3) normalize the depth maps (note that the foreground should have higher value than the background in our method)

2) resize the testing data to the size of 224*224

3) put your rgb images to 'test_real' folder and your depth maps to 'depth_real' folder (paired rgb image and depth map should have same name)


### Test
```
python main_test.py

find the results in the 'test_real' folder with the same name as the input image + "_out".

You can use a script to resize the results back to the same size as the original RGB-D image,  or just use the results with a size of 224*224 for evaluations. We did not find much differences for the evaluation results.
